            <h2>What is it like to live on the coast by the sea?</h2>
            <p>It's great, but more specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You get to live on the coast by the sea</li>
                <li>You can walk along the coast</li>
                <li>You can swim in the sea (when there is no sewage dumping going on)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Top three things to do on the beach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Swim</li>
                <li>Watch the waves</li>
                <li>Throw pebbles into the sea</li>
            </ol>
